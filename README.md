# A PowerShell GUI

A work in progress.

Getting to grips with powershell can be daunting. This UI is to be a starting
point for people learning powershell as well as toolbox for experts to build and save
their favorite scripts.

Ultimately I'd like it to be a graphical IDE for connecting scriptlets together into workflows.

## Pre-requisites
```
We have a .hta version which can be run on Windows without any extras.
The HTML5 application requires nodeJS, NPM and Electron.
```
npm install -g electron
```

## Installation
To install and run the HTML version:
```
git clone https://github.com/cawoodm/powershell-ui.git
cd powershell-ui
npm install
npm start

```
