# A PowerShell GUI

A work in progress.

Getting to grips with powershell can be daunting. This UI is to be a starting
point for people learning powershell as well as toolbox for experts to build and save
their favorite scripts.

Ultimately I'd like it to be a graphical IDE for connecting scriptlets together into workflows.
